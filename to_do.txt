I am going to need

lay out the HTML

5 input fields and a submit button

Engage event listener to pass the inputs of these fields into jQuery

These inputs will need to feed an object Constructor

The object constructor should push to an array

I should have a function that loop through the array and pushes each attribute
of an object to a table

The table should be appended with each submit

When a new employee is added the fields must clear

There should be a running total of the .annualSalary attribute
This total should be updated upon submitClick

I will need an if/else to see if total of all annualSalaries is greater than 20,000
- if it is, CSS styes must be changed to a red background

~~~~~~~~~~~~
FOR HARD MODE
an additional button will need to be added to the table to delete (i.e. hide) an employee
